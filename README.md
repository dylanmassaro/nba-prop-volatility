NBA player prop risk &amp; volatility analysis with product/revenue implications


Problem Statement: 

Sports betting is a massive industry. They offer NBA player prop markets that can fluctuate a lot
due to player performance volatility. The pricing teams must decide which props are "safe" to allow users to bet on, minimizing risk for the platform. 

This project aims to quantify player-level prop volatility using historical NBA game data and seeing if we can identify contextual signals that explain risk. Understanding these patterns can inform pricing strategy, promotion design, and user targeting (separating users by tendencies).

Decisions that this project supports:
- pricing aggresiveness
- promo eligibility
- market selection
- user targeting (casual vs sharp)
